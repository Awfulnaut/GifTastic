# GifTastic
GifTastic leverages the Giphy API to display 10 gifs when the user clicks any of the topic buttons. The user can use the input field to enter a new query that adds a button with that topic on the page. Each gif that appears will display the rating above it, and begins in a "still" state. Each Gif can be clicked in order to "play" them, and they can be paused again in the same manner. There is a "more" button that appears at the bottom of the page when a query is initiated that will add an additional 10 gifs of the current topic to the page.

This project was built with jQuery and uses the Giphy API. If you have questions or need help, you can reach out to me at cadin.mcqueen@gmail.com.
